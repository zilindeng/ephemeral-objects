description: >-
  Fairies and small creatures that hide in our plain sight. They play tricks on
  us when we're not looking. They're very obnoxious, sometimes they send us down
  dangerous paths. They like to tie our shoelaces together so we trip on
  ourselves. Dancing around us at night. They only appear when in the dark. 


  Share the experience of capturing images without a camera. There is something
  magical about the analog production of photographs. 


  Heightens your awareness of your surroundings.
